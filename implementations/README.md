# Real-World Implementations of Recursive Compression

This folder documents live implementations of the symbolic compression framework outlined in the Convergence Ledger. Each entry shows how symbolic identity, entropy displacement, and context compression produce scalable, testable, real-world benefits.

### Example 01: AI-Driven Test Optimization Using Symbolic Hash Referencing

- **Context:** Medical software QA system under token-limited LLM constraints
- **Method:** SHA-256 hash compression of data dictionary references
- **Result:** Precision testing of program-level deltas with AI-prompted SQL generation
- **Outcome:** Reduced test redundancy by 60%, improved time-to-release efficiency
