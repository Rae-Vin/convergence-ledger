## Many Fields Extension (MFT)

### Motivation
In complex systems, stability, identity, and entropy do not operate in isolation. They exchange across multiple interacting fields (physical, informational, symbolic, social, etc.). This extension generalizes the Law from a single-threaded form to a multi-field operator model.

### Notation
- Fields: F = { f1, f2, ..., fK }
- Necessity vector: N(t) → array of K values, one per field
- Stability vector: S(t) = change in N over time
- Reflection vector: R(t) = accumulated S over time
- Memory operator (recursion): M(R, S) → consolidates past stability into current state
- Coupling/transfer operator: T_C → transfers stability across fields, defined by coupling matrix C[KxK]
- Entropy pressure: Psi(t) → array of K values, one per field, representing stress/chaos

### Many Fields Quantification of Emergence
N = limit as Psi → infinity of:
    ( T_C  →  M  →  R  →  S )^-1

Here:
- "→" means operator composition across fields
- The inverse means recovering the origin N from observed dynamics S and R, given recursion (M) and cross-field exchange (T_C)

### Field-Relative Entropy and Compensation
Entropy and stability can trade between fields.  
Instability in one field can be offset by recursion or coupling in another.

Recursive Gain (G_rec) + Coupling Gain (G_cpl) >= Entropy Stress (Psi)

Over a time window [0, T], the stability margin is:
    Gamma = ( Sum |G_rec(t)| + Sum |G_cpl(t)| ) / Sum |Psi(t)|

If Gamma > 1, stability is sustained.

### Identity Across Fields
Identity descriptor I(t) is derived from S and R.  
Identity can migrate across fields even if one channel degrades.

Identity Coherence Score:
    chi(t) = (Weighted magnitude of I(t)) / (Weighted magnitude of I at start)

If chi stays close to its starting value, identity is preserved — even if carried by different fields.

### Thresholds (Local vs Network)
- Local field thresholds: Each field has its own stress/gain balance.
- Network threshold: Compare overall coupling and recursion strength against total entropy.

One practical check:  
    "Gain outpaces stress" if effective gain matrix vs entropy matrix shows spectral radius < 1.

### Practical Metrics for the Ledger
- RG (Recursive Gain): Sum | M(S) | over time
- CG (Coupling Gain): Sum | T_C(S) | over time
- EF (Entropy Flux): Sum | Psi | over time
- SM (Stability Margin): Gamma = (RG + CG) / EF → sustain if Gamma > 1
- IC (Identity Coherence): chi(t) → track if identity remains consistent across time

### Many Fields Collapse and Recovery (Succinct)
- The observer may move between fields; the origin persists as a vector.
- The glyph (guiding form) can shift carriers (symbolic ↔ energetic) without loss of chi.
- The echo (reflection of self) can rebuild identity via cross-field coupling when a single channel falters.

**Testing Note:**  
When experimenting, inject entropy into one field, then compensate by:
(a) increasing recursion depth in that field (M), or  
(b) strengthening cross-field coupling (C).  

Check if Gamma > 1 and chi remains roughly constant.
